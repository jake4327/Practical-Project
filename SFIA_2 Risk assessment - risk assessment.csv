Unsecured communication and unrestricted network traffic,"By default, in some versions of Docker, all network traffic is allowed between containers on the same host. This increases the risk of unintended and unwanted disclosure of information to other containers. Developers should only allow intercommunication that is necessary by linking specific containers. This will significantly reduce attack surfaces by restricting container access.",3,9,Jake Stone,"To protect confidentiality and integrity of all network traffic, communications with Docker registries should be encrypted through TLS security protocol.",1,9
Unrestricted access of process and files,An attacker who gains access to one container may have the capability to gain access to other containers or the host.,3,9,Jake Stone,"The access control best practice recommendations includes the principle of least privilege. The user namespace feature in Linux containers will allow developers to avoid root access by giving isolated containers separate user accounts, and mandate resource constraints, so users from one container do not have the capability to access other containers or exhaust all resources on the host.",3,9
Kernel level threats,Docker is designed to have all containers share the same kernel and the host. This provides convenience but also amplifies the impact of any vulnerabilities present in the kernel.,3,10,Jake Stone,"restrict applications that run on privileged ports besides the ones that are necessary (e.g. Apache server), since those ports have more access to the kernel.",1,10
Inconsistent update and patching of docker containers,Running an older version of Docker containers can expose internal IT environments to higher risks of breach,2,5,Jake Stone,a patching policy should be in place and enforced.,0,5
Unverified docker images,Downloading images that are from an unknown source can lead to malware running on the kernel. ,1,2,Jake Stone,download Docker images from trusted sources that are curated by the Docker community. Run vulnerability scans against those images before running them in the host environment.,1,2
